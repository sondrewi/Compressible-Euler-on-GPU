Report and code submitted for a coursework on the MPhil in Scientific Computing. The assignment was focused on implementing a high-order numerical scheme, of the student's choice, 
for the 2D compressible Euler equations on an NVIDIA GPU. The code was to be applied to reference problems from the literature. The results were to be validated and compared against a CPU implementation. 
The purpose of the different files is detailed in the report itself.
