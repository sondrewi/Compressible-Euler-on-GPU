The Code in this zip-file is intended for use on machines connected to an Nvidia A30 GPU. When the provided Makefile file is run, the following files will be compiled
Grid.cpp (Grid class for CPU Solver)
Slope_Limiter.cpp (Slope Limiter for CPU Solver)
Riemann.cpp (subclass of Grid used to solve exactly the Riemann problems at cell interfaces)
Solver.cpp (Object whose function "step" initialises objects of the other types in order to solve 2D Euler equations using MUSCL-Hancock Scheme)
CUDA_Grid.cu (Grid object for GPU Solver maintaining references to arrays on GPU and into which a the final solution arrays are copied)
DeviceKernels.cu File containing CUDA __global__ kernels to be called by CUDA_Grid objects and further __device__ functions which may be called by the kernels themselves)
MACROS.H (Header file containing the definitions of various constants useful throughout the computations on both CPU and GPU)
CUDAtests.cu (File containing main() function which calls the relevant function to solve either the quadrant problem from Liska & Wendroff or the Bubble problem from Bagadir & Drikakis given user input. Note that the user must directly change the grid dimensions in CUDAtests.cu to obtain comparable solutions)

CUDAtests.cu outputs the solution of the given 2D Euler equation initial value problem computed on both CPU and GPU in the file Solutions.dat. The file has the format
x_coord y_coord rho_CPU rho_CUDA vx_CPU vx_CUDA vy_CPU vy_CUDA p_CPU p_CUDA

The results may be plotted using the general script in plots.py.
